      This project was created to help small and medium e-commerce businesses compete in a fast-changing digital world. Using AI and big data from platforms like Google Trends, TikTok, YouTube, and Amazon, our system helps predict what products will trend next — and how to advertise them efficiently.

      Our mission is to democratize access to marketing intelligence, enabling smarter decisions for everyone, not just big corporations.
